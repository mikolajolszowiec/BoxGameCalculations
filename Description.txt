Assignment
Task consist of two parts. First you need to calculate expected value of reward when playing one
round of described game, using a 10 000 000 game rounds simulation.
In the second part you need to find expected value of reward in this game using other method,
preferably in java code, but other solutions are also acceptable. What is crucial, your calculations have
to be exact, no simulation here.
Both programs should print to standard output single decimal number, and of course both results
should be similar.
Description:
Consider a mini-game.
The player sees 12 boxes. They open box after box until a "Game over sign" appears.
The boxes contain various rewards that are randomly divided between the boxes.
The contents are:
• 1x €100
• 2x €20
• 5x €5
• 1x "Extra life". If one of these boxes are awarded, the next "Game over sign" is nullified.
• 3x "Game over sign" - ends the game.
When the game is over, the player gets an additional reward. It is chosen randomly from four options:
• € 5, €10, €20, "Second chance" - return to the game, shuffle cards and start from beginning.
The next time the game finishes, the "Second chance" option is disabled (only the three above options
are available)
Technical requirements:
Use an object-oriented approach with the Java 8 programming language;
Maven;
Junit;
